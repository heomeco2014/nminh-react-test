# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), by Minh to complete the React assignment.

## How to run

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` or `pnpm install` or `bun install`
3. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` or `bun dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

## Features & Libraries

1. Using React + TypeScript + HRM + Vite
2. Using ShadCN UI + TailwindCSS for styling
3. Using Recharts for charting
4. Only using React Context API for state management (I tend to use Redux or Zustand for a bigger project)

## Bonus features checklist

1. Add a loading spinner while the data is being fetched --> Added `Skeleton Loading` since I think it's more user-friendly
2. Make the dashboard fully responsive.
